# 100 Days of Python

To catch up on my Python skills, I'm currently following the "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu on Udemy.

I took this course to improve my skills in python, while also building my portofolio.

This repository contain all my notes and projects while trying to complete this course.
