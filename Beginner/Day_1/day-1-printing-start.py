##### Printing #####

# print("A 'single quote' inside a double quote")
# print('A "double quote" inside a single quote')
# print("Alternatively you can juste \"escape\" the quote")

##### String Manipulation #####

# print("Hello World!\nHello World!\nHello world!")

# name = "AFCM"

# print("Hello" + " " + name)

##### The Python Input Function #####

# print("Hello " + input("What is your name? "))

# name = input("What's your name?: ")
# len(name)
# print(len(name))

# name = input(())
# len(name)
# print(len(name))

# print(len(input()))

##### Python Variables #####

# name = input("What is your name?")
# print(name)

# name = "Jack"
# print(name)

# print(len(input("What is your name?"))) #long line of code
#use of variables
# name = input('What\'s your name?')
# print(len(name))

# name = input("What\'s your name?")
# length = len(name)
# print(length)


# There are two variables, a and b from input
# a = input()
# b = input()
# # 🚨 Don't change the code above ☝️
# ####################################
# # Write your code below this line 👇
# c = a # c = Hello
# a = b # a = World
# b = c # b = Hello

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
# print("a: " + a)
# print("b: " + b)


##### Final Project #####

#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("What's the name of the city you grew in?\n")
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet_name = input("What\'s your pet name?\n")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet_name)
#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line:
